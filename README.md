## Project Rationale and Objectives

### **Rationale**
The resurgence of vinyl records in the digital age has led to a growing demand for online platforms where collectors can browse and purchase records efficiently. Most existing platforms are either outdated in design, lack advanced filtering options, or do not cater specifically to the vinyl community. Eternal Records aims to bridge this gap by offering an intuitive user interface, comprehensive search functionality, and seamless purchasing options.

### **Objectives**
- Develop a fully functional e-commerce platform using Django.
- Implement a secure and user-friendly authentication system.
- Integrate a shopping cart and checkout system supporting PayPal and M-Pesa.
- Optimize the platform for speed and scalability.
- Implement a recommendation system to suggest records based on user preferences.
- Ensure mobile responsiveness for a seamless user experience.

## **System Architecture and Tech Stack**

### **Technologies Used**
- **Backend:** Django, Django REST Framework (for API integration)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with Bootstrap for responsiveness)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (for production), SQLite (for development/testing)
- **Payment Gateway:** PayPal and M-Pesa API integration
- **Hosting:** Deployed on AWS EC2 with Nginx and Gunicorn

### **Folder Structure**
The Django project follows a structured and modular architecture:
```

## **Development Process**

### **1. Setting Up the Django Project**
To begin, the Django project was initialized with the following command:
```bash
django-admin startproject eternal_records
```
Then, a dedicated app for handling store-related functionalities was created:
```bash
python manage.py startapp store
```
The necessary apps were registered in `settings.py` under `INSTALLED_APPS`:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'store',
    'users',
    'cart',
    'checkout',
]
```

### **2. Database Modeling**
The platform required various database models to manage products, users, orders, and the cart. Below is an example of the `Product` model:
```python
from django.db import models

class Product(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    artist = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    genre = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    stock = models.PositiveIntegerField()
    image = models.ImageField(upload_to='product_images/')
    
    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
```

---

## **Challenges Faced and Solutions**

### **1. Payment Gateway Integration**
- **Challenge:** Implementing PayPal and M-Pesa required secure API authentication and data validation.
- **Solution:** Django’s built-in CSRF protection and environment variables for storing sensitive API keys were used. The implementation was tested in sandbox mode before production.

### **2. User Authentication and Authorization**
- **Challenge:** Ensuring secure user authentication while allowing social logins.
- **Solution:** Django’s built-in authentication system was customized, and Django-Allauth was used for social logins.

### **3. Cart Management and Session Handling**
- **Challenge:** Persisting cart data for both logged-in and guest users.
- **Solution:** Implemented session-based carts for guests and database-stored carts for logged-in users.

### **4. SEO and Performance Optimization**
- **Challenge:** Ensuring fast load times and SEO-friendly URLs.
- **Solution:** Implemented caching with Redis and optimized images using Django’s `ImageField`.
